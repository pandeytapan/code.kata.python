- The `defaultdict` calls the `__default_factory__` only for the `__getitem__`.
- The underlying thing that actually gets called is the `__missing__`.
- Derive a class from the `dict` and provide it with the `__missing__` now instead of the `KeyError` we will see the `__missing__` getting called for the `__getitem__`.
- When using `[]` for the dictionary it uses the `getitem` to retrieve the values. However, `get` is used exclusively to retrieve the values.
- In such cases the `get` never makes the use of the `[]`.
- Whenever we have a missing key the `__getitem__` will call the `__missing__`. This gives us the opportunity to handle the missing key and provide one
